Note: requesting a plugin does not 100% guarantee that I will create one.

**Please give some information**
1. Which mod would you like a plug made for?
2. What is broken between the mods right now? (An inventory not being captured? On-death logic not playing nicely?)
3. Have you contacted the other mod author to request compatibility be made via the publicly available  API (TombManyGraves2API)? If so, please reference the corresponding issue in their repository.
4. Any other details I need to know in order to convince me to create this plugin?
